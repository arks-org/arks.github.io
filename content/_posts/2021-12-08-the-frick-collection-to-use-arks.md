The Frick Collection has chosen ARK persistent identifiers to enhance
long-term stewardship of its digital assets, offering flexibility for diverse
scholarly resources and materials.

<!--more-->

The [Frick Collection] plans to assign ARK persistent identifiers as part of
its commitment to the long-term stewardship of our publicly available digital
assets. Guiding this decision was the flexibility of the ARK identifier scheme
in terms of metadata and content, which lends itself to the range of materials
and future use cases that we anticipate.

Our website makes available a unique resource for research in the humanities
and art history, providing access to over 1.8 million pages of material. That
includes images and documentation for works of art, books in the public
domain, and the archives of The Frick Collection. ARK identifiers are a
natural choice to support this diversity of scholarly resources.
