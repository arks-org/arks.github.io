The Haute école de gestion de Genève (HEG-GE) will soon release its ARK
allocation service, called **ARKetype**, which was created with the help of
the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) within the context of the
[INCIPIT] project financed by [swissuniversities].

On **Wednesday, January 27th between 10:30 am and 12:00 noon Central European
Time**, we will introduce the service with a free online event called **[Ask
Me Anything]**. Presentations will be in English and the Q&A (Question and
Answer) session will be in French, German and English.

Library as well as the ARK Alliance for their help and support during the
INCIPIT project and the establishment of ARKetype.
