ARKetype, a new ARK allocation service by HEG-GE and SIB, will be introduced
on Jan 27 in an online event.

<!--more-->

The Haute école de gestion de Genève (HEG-GE) will soon release its ARK
allocation service, called **ARKetype**, which was created with the help of
the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB) within the context of the
[INCIPIT] project financed by [swissuniversities].

On **Wednesday, January 27th between 10:30 am and 12:00 noon Central European
Time**, we will introduce the service with a free online event called **[Ask
Me Anything]**. Presentations will be in English and the Q&A (Question and
Answer) session will be in French, German and English.
