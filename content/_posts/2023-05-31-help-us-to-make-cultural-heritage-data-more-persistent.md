Persistent identifiers are key to making cultural heritage data interoperable
and encouraging reuse amongst audiences. Discover how the common European data
space for cultural heritage consortium is working to support the sector to use
these and take [our survey] to share your thoughts!

Building a [common European data space for cultural heritage] where data can
be easily shared for reuse requires organisations that create data
infrastructures to rely, as much as possible, on unique and persistent
identifiers.

As the steward of the data space, Europeana Foundation, together with the 18
consortium members, is investing resources in reviewing the adoption and
implementation of persistent identifiers in the cultural heritage sector. Read
on to discover what persistent identifiers are, how we are doing this, and how
you can get involved.

## *What is a persistent identifier?*

A Persistent Identifier (PID) is a globally unique and long-lasting reference
to potentially any sort of digital or non-digital entity, providing the
information required to reliably identify, verify, locate and access it. They
ensure that the digital entity is ‘set in stone’ and can always be findable
through that identifier.

Examples of PIDs are [Archival Resource Key (ARK)], [Digital Object Identifier
(DOI)], [National Bibliography Numbers (NBN)], [Persistent Identifiers for
eResearch (ePIC)], among others.

To see how they work in practice, take, for example, the Mona Lisa (La
Joconde). The painting is identified by an ARK persistent identifier,
‘ark:/53355/cl010066723’. If this persistent identifier is entered into
relevant software (in this case, it can be resolved via the [N2T global
resolver] to ‘<https://n2t.net/ark:/53355/cl010066723>)’ it then presents the
webpage from the Louvre where the digitised object is presented alongside its
digital representations. La Joconde will always be identifiable and findable
on the web through this identifier.

## **Why are persistent identifiers important for the data space for cultural heritage?**

Persistent identification sits at the foundation of the [FAIR principles]
which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. The adoption
of persistent identifiers by cultural heritage institutions with digital
collections shows commitment towards interoperability and data access that in
turn builds trust in the institution and the data it creates. Adoption of
persistent identifiers will also support the dissemination and reuse of
cultural heritage objects, helping to make them more accessible to audiences
across the data space.

Not assigning persistent identifiers to digitised cultural heritage objects
can also have a negative impact. The most common manifestation of the absence
of a persistent identifier strategy are broken links which, besides affecting
all forms of (re)use, also negatively impact the traffic towards the
institution’s website and its SEO ranking amongst search engines.

## **Your input is key**

We want to establish a consolidated and more robust persistent identification
framework for the data space, and to do that, we need to understand your
practices and activities towards the creation and management of persistent
identifiers. Easier access to cultural heritage data, interoperability within
and beyond the data space, discovery and reuse of cultural heritage data
depend on it!

If you work in the technical or operational teams of a cultural heritage
institution, and know how your institution manages identifiers for digitised
objects, or if you are running an aggregation service, we invite you to take
approximately 15 minutes to answer our survey. Please also share it with other
colleagues that are most involved in this work.

The deadline for survey responses is **30 June 2023**. Thank you in advance
for your participation!
