Today being [World Digital Preservation Day](https://www.dpconline.org/events/world-digital-preservation-day),
we are delighted to announce that the number of ARK organizations has surpassed 1400. That number includes

- 10 national libraries
- 185 universities
- 209 archives
- 104 museums
- 101 journals

In the past year we have  been busy converting both the ARK Alliance website 
(originally under WordPress) and working group wiki (originally under Confluence) 
to GitHub-based hosting. Meanwhile,

- 224 new ARK organizations were registered,
- 8 ARK tutorials of varying length were given at conferences for Open Repositories,
  Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, Latindex, Linked Open Data, and the Western
  Association of Map Libraries, and
- a new [Spanish and Portuguese discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/g/arks-forum-ib) was created

xxx 224 as of 11.04

We are also excited to tell you of a promising new open source software package for 
organizations implementing ARKs. Based on the Internet Archive's 
[arklet](https://github.com/squidgetx/arklet-frick/tree/master) 
implementation, developers at The Frick Collection have created the open source
[arklet-Frick](https://github.com/squidgetx/arklet-frick/tree/master). 
It adds improved security and bugfixes, as well as bulk operations, suffix passthrough, 
shoulder rules, extensive metadata, endpoints for `?info` and `?json`, and more.

As always we welcome volunteers for our [working groups](https://arks.org/community-groups/): 
Outreach, Technical, and NAAN Curation. If you wish to volunteer, please express your interest
by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/15bhmP5Z0aOLaTWfXKK0TBTJCOAXuT30hIzfhij-D_oM)

We now have stunning new vinyl ARK Alliance stickers! They are in a standard
hexagonal format suitable for tiling your laptop, phone, refrigerator, etc.
Currently they can only be ordered [online here] via Stickermule.

We are also happy to announce that a 3-hour ARK tutorial has been given this
year at the annual Code4lib and IIIF conferences ([slides here]). There are
four more tutorials coming up:

-   90 mins at [DWeb Camp] around June 20
-   180 mins at [Joint Conference on Digital Libraries] (ACM/IEEE JCDL) June
    26
-   60 mins at [Earth Science Information Partners] (ESIP) July 20
-   90 mins at [International Conference on Digital Preservation] (iPRES)
    around Sept 20

Finally we would like to announce availability of the [ARK Community Code of
Conduct]. This document represents consensus across the ARK Alliance Advisory
Group and the NAAN Registry, Outreach, and Technical Working Groups. Working
documents for these groups are linked from the sidebar on the [ARKA wiki].
