*Percent of ARK organizations per top-level domain. #WDPD2024*

Today being [World Digital Preservation Day](https://www.dpconline.org/events/world-digital-preservation-day),
we are delighted to announce that the number of ARK organizations has surpassed 1400. That number includes

- 10 national libraries
- 185 universities
- 209 archives
- 104 museums
- 101 journals

In the past year we have  been busy converting both the ARK Alliance website 
(originally under WordPress) and working group wiki (originally under Confluence) 
to GitHub-based hosting. Meanwhile,

- 224 new ARK organizations were registered,
- 8 ARK tutorials of varying length were given at conferences such as Open Repositories,
  Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, Latindex, Linked Open Data, and the Western
  Association of Map Libraries, 
- a [30-minute ARK tutorial video](https://youtu.be/-RkMGFCGRic) was made available, and
- a new [Spanish and Portuguese discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/g/arks-forum-ib) was created.

We are also excited to share a promising new open source software package for 
organizations implementing ARKs. Starting with the Internet Archive's 
[arklet](https://github.com/squidgetx/arklet-frick/tree/master) 
implementation, developers at The Frick Collection have created the
[arklet-Frick](https://github.com/squidgetx/arklet-frick/tree/master) tool. 
It adds improved security and bugfixes, as well as bulk operations, suffix passthrough, 
shoulder rules, extensive metadata, endpoints for `?info` and `?json`, and more. See the
[about]({{ "/about" | absolute_url }}) pages for more information on these concepts.

As always we welcome volunteers for our
[working groups]({{ "/community-groups/" | absolute_url }}): 
Outreach, Technical, and NAAN Curation.
If you wish to volunteer, please express your interest by filling out
