The PID Guide, an interactive resource by the National Archives of the
Netherlands, now includes ARKs, DOIs, Handles, and URNs to aid organizations
worldwide in selecting suitable Persistent Identifier systems for their needs.

<!--more-->

It is not always easy for organizations to understand and choose an
appropriate Persistent Identifier (PID) system. PIDs such as ARKs, DOIs,
Handles, and URNs can come with subtle tradeoffs that depend on each
organization’s needs.

The PID Guide helps you learn and think about important PID topics, and guides
your first steps towards selecting a PID system.

Thus the PID Guide at [pidwijzer.nl] was created as a free, interactive
service to help people learn and think about important PID topics, and to
guide their first steps in selecting a PID system. The digital preservation
team of the National Archives of the Netherlands maintains the guide, and in
April 2023 we were pleased to announce a new version, which now includes ARK,
DataCite DOI, Handle System and URN:NBN.

The PID Guide was originally created by the Dutch Digital Heritage Network
(DDHN). In developing the new version, we are grateful for the help of
colleagues from the ARK Alliance, TU Delft Library (DataCite Netherlands),
SURF, KB national library, DANS (Data Archiving and Networked Services) and
DDHN.

The term “PID-wijzer” is a nod to “stemwijzer”, a sort of Dutch voting
compass, and the term “wijzer” is a Dutch word (which sounds a bit like
“visor”) meaning one who points, directs, or indicates. Although intended for
Dutch heritage organizations, the [pidwijzer.nl] service may be useful to
organizations all over the world. On the other hand, because our hosted
instance is tailored to the Dutch situation, there is also a [PID Guide
Toolkit], which can be used to create independent instances of the interactive
guide adapted to different contexts and use cases.
