An open source plugin enables ARK usage in Open Journal Systems (OJS),
supporting articles, issues, and galleys.

<!--more-->

I am happy to share with the ARK community an open source plugin that I
developed for creating and resolving ARKs with [Open Journal Systems] (OJS).
It lets OJS journal publishers assign and use ARKs for their articles, issues,
and galleys.

The plugin is compatible with OJS versions 3.x.x and is currently used to
publish the journal, *[Innovación y Software]*, of which I am the
editor-in-chief. You can find the plugin at my [github repo].

First journal to use the ARK OJS plugin.

Installation and configuration for the plugin is documented (PDFs) in English
([ARK Plugin Guide for OJS]) and Español ([Guia del Plugin ARK para OJS]). At
the moment there is language support only for English and Spanish, but support
for more languages is planned. Any help filling out the complement of other
languages would be welcome.

If you have any questions, queries, or need any assistance, please do not
hesitate to email me at yasielpv at gmail dot com. Finally, I would also like
to thank Carlos Authier and John Kunze for their support in this initiative.
