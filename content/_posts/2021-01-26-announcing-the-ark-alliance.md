The ARK Alliance, succeeding ARKs-in-the-Open, has grown with 700+
organizations, 4 working groups, and a new website at arks.org.

<!--more-->

We are thrilled to introduce the ARK Alliance as heir to the successful
ARKs-in-the-Open initiative, which began in 2018 with the goal of launching an
open, global community around Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) and their use as
persistent identifiers in the scholarly ecosystem. And just this week the
700th ARK-assigning organization was registered!

Since 2018 the ARK Alliance has established 4 working groups, gained support
of 39 institutions, and added 286 new ARK-assigning organizations.

We invite you to visit us at [arks.org]

which is our new website. It hosts a blog that feeds a newsletter, including
this post in its first issue. Our new twitter handle is @arks_org, which
replaces the *@ARKsInTheOpen* handle while retaining its followers and
“following” lists.

To make things easier to find, ARK information hosted at the old website wiki
([arksintheopen.org]) will soon finish moving over to the new [arks.org][arks.org] site. That
applies as well to ARK information hosted at [N2T.net], which will otherwise
carry on undisturbed in its role as a global ARK resolver.

As an exception, the working group collaborative materials will still be
hosted on the wiki. Meanwhile the ARKs forum email lists are unchanged and we
are very happy to continue to have support from the California Digital
Library, LYRASIS, and many others. Special thanks to Tracy Seneca, Peter
Collopy, and Julien Raemy for their help in this transition.

The ARK Alliance welcomes participation, which can take many forms. Please
visit the [community] page to learn about ways to become involved.
