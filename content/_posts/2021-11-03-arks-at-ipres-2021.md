ARKs were the focus of a presentation given remotely at the iPRES
International Conference on Digital Preservation on October 22. The iPRES
conferences have visited four continents since 2004, and in 2021 it returned
to its starting place, Beijing. Due to the pandemic, this year of course it
met in hybrid virtual/in-person mode. The presentation slides below are [also
available on slideshare.net].
