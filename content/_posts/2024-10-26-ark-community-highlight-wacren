Title: ARK Community Highlight: West and Central African Research and Education Network (WACREN)
Authors: Omo Oaiya, Sefakor Ankora, Elizabeth Yayra Tordzro, Donald Doe Seanedzu, Keziah Okyere

The West and Central African Research and Education Network (WACREN) is
committed to advancing research and education through robust network
infrastructure and innovative technological solutions across the region. As the
association of NRENs in the region, our organisation plays a pivotal role in
fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among academic and research
institutions, thus contributing to the socio-economic development of West and
Central Africa.

While we are relatively new to utilising ARKs, we have swiftly integrated them
into our operations. Specifically, we have developed a 
[software platform](https://pidslink.wacren.net) dedicated to minting and resolving 
ARKs, harnessing their unique capabilities to enhance our services and support our
organisational goals. The platform is built on 
[arklet-frick](https://github.com/squidgetx/arklet-frick/tree/master), created by
developers at The [Frick Collection](https://www.frick.org/), which itself was
originally based on code from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org). The
open source code for our platform will be made available.

We are pleased to announce the development of our new ARKs Management
Dashboard, designed to streamline the management of minted arks with ease and
accessibility in mind. Whether you're new to ARKs or a seasoned user, our
user-friendly dashboard empowers you to efficiently manage and track resources
assigned to your ARKs without requiring any technical expertise. Providing
a centralised space for storing and managing minted ARKs, you can easily view
and organise them to ensure efficient resource allocation and utilisation. 

In addition to the dashboard's intuitive functionality, we offer an API that
seamlessly integrates with other applications. This API enables developers and
users to extend the capabilities of our dashboard, integrate it with existing
systems, and automate processes, enhancing workflow efficiency and flexibility.

Our decision to implement ARKs was based on the PIDs roadmap from our 
[LIBSENSE initiative](https://libsense.ren.africa/en/libsense-develops-a-roadmap-for-implementing-persistent-identifiers-in-africa-re-ecosystem/), we carefully evaluated various Persistent Identifier (PID) options
and found ARKs most suitable for our requirements. Their flexibility,
interoperability, and robust resolution mechanisms aligned perfectly with our
needs, making them the preferred choice for our organisation.

The adoption of ARKs has significantly transformed the way we work. By
incorporating ARKs into our platform, we have streamlined our processes and
improved the management and accessibility of digital resources. This has
increased efficiency, reduced redundancy, and enhanced discoverability,
ultimately empowering our users and facilitating collaboration within the
research and education community.

The benefits of utilising ARKs are manifold. They provide a reliable means of
persistently identifying digital resources, ensuring long-term accessibility
and citation. Additionally, ARKs facilitate interoperability between different
systems and platforms, enabling seamless integration and data exchange.
Moreover, the robust resolution services associated with ARKs enhance the user
experience by delivering accurate and reliable access to resources, thus
fostering trust and confidence in our services.

Although we have yet to pilot the full usage of ARKs with our platform, initial
feedback has been positive. Stakeholders have expressed enthusiasm for
implementing ARKs and anticipate their potential benefits to our organisation
and the broader research and education community in West and Central Africa. We
will be considering pilot partners at the University of Ghana and  Eko-Konnect.
