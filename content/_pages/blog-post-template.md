Create and share your story about ARK identifiers with others. This template can
help spark ideas for an ARK organization description of their ARK service.

<!--more-->

This is a set of questions designed to help people create a few paragraphs of 
content to tell the story of an organization's use of ARK persistent identifiers. 
It is not meant to constrain what a blog post might be, but it may help to generate 
a few paragraphs suitable for https://arks.org/news blog and the ARK Alliance (ARKA) 
newsletter. The blog post title could be something like

    ARK Organization Highlight: <Organization Name, for example, the National Library of Narnia>
 
How long has your organization been using ARKs?
 
In what ways do you use them?
 
Why did you opt to implement ARKs? Did you consider other PIDs (persistent identifiers)?
 
How have ARKs changed the way you work? What benefits have you seen?
 
What is an example of the feedback have you received since you implemented ARKs?

Would you have some charismatic images that we could include to illustrate your collection, service, organization, etc?
