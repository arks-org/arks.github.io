Create and share your story about ARK identifiers with others. This template can
help spark ideas for an ARK organization to describe their ARK service.

<!--more-->

These are questions to help get started telling the story of your organization's use of ARKs.

1. What do you create ARKs for?
2. How do you mint them?
3. What/who is your organization?

Below are more questions that may help you create a few paragraphs of content suitable for the
blog at https://arks.org/news or the ARK Alliance newsletter. The title could be something like

    ARK Organization Highlight: <Organization Name, for example, the National Library of Narnia>
 
4. How long has your organization been using ARKs?
5. In what ways do you use them?
6. Why did you opt to implement ARKs? Did you consider other PIDs (persistent identifiers)?
7. How have ARKs changed the way you work? What benefits have you seen?
8. What is an example of the feedback have you received since you implemented ARKs?
9. Would you have some charismatic images that we could include to illustrate your collection, service, organization, etc?
