We value the participation of each member of the ARK (Archival Resource Key)
community. For the purposes of this document, the community includes the
working groups sustaining the ARK infrastructure (eg, arks.org,
arksintheopen.org, n2t.net) as well as the people participating in the
official [English] and [French] ARK discussion lists. Accordingly, all
community members are expected to show respect and courtesy within all
community spaces.

This Code of Conduct document describes the commitment of contributors and
leaders in the ARK Alliance (arks.org) to make the ARK community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body appearance
and size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation and
gender identity,and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, race, caste, color, religion.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

-   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
-   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
-   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
-   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our
    mistakes, and learning from the experience
-   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
    overall community
-   Encouraging all community members, even those for whom oral or written
    communication is more difficult, to express themselves freely

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
    advances of any kind
-   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political
    attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Silencing community or audience members by repeated interruption
-   Publishing others’ private information, such as a phone number, or
    physical or email address, without their explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community Leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful. In this document, the Community Leaders that are responsible for
enforcement are the chairs and co-chairs of the ARK Alliance (ARKA) working
groups, as listed on this page:
<https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/ARKs/ARK+Alliance+Community+Leaders>.

Community Leaders may be contacted by email at this address:
<arka-conduct@googlegroups.com>. They have the right and responsibility to
remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will
communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies
when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using Github, Slack, Discord,
an official email forum or address, posting via an official social media
account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline
event. To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, speakers,
exhibitors, organizers, participants and volunteers in any ARK community
virtual or in-person space are required to conform to this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the Community Leaders responsible for enforcement at the private
list <arka-conduct@googlegroups.com>. If you would prefer, you may email one
or more individuals listed in the [Community Leaders page] mentioned earlier.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All Community Leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

Reports of harassment or discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly
investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or
activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
Violators of these guidelines can expect to be asked to leave an event or
online community space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event,
or to be banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities
in perpetuity.

## Reporting Guidelines

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate
responders first.** If you are unsure what types of responders are
appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify
them.

In your report please include:

-   Your contact information (so we can get in touch with you if we need to
    follow up)
-   Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If
    there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as
    well.
-   When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
-   Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record
    (e.g. a mailing list archive) please include a link.
-   Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
-   If you believe this incident is ongoing.
-   Any other information you believe we should have.

## What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email within one business day from a Community Leader
acknowledging receipt. A review of the incident will take place immediately to
determine:

-   What happened.
-   Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
-   Who the bad actor was.
-   Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to anyone’s
    physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical
safety, the immediate priority will be to protect everyone involved. This
means an “official” response may be delayed until the situation has ended and
everyone is physically safe.

The person who filed the report will receive a response within one week
containing either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not
yet resolved. In addition, an account of the report and the final resolution
will be made to the ARKA Advisory Group.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community Leaders will consider the following community impact levels in
determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this
Code of Conduct.

### **1. Correction**

Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from Community Leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. The Community Leaders may request a public
apology.

### **2. Warning**

Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external
channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### **3. Temporary Ban**

Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a period of time specified by the
Community Leaders. No public or private interaction with the people involved,
including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is
allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### **4. Permanent Ban**

Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards,
including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or
aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## What if your report concerns a possible violation by a Community Leader?

If your report concerns a Community Leader, you may not feel comfortable
contacting the <arka-conduct@googlegroups.com> list, as all Community Leaders
will see the report.

In that case, you can make a report directly to any of the individuals on the
Community Leaders page. The individuals will follow the usual enforcement
process with the other members, but will exclude the member(s) that the report
concerns from any discussion or decision making.

## Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest a Community Leader must immediately
notify the other leaders, and recuse themselves if necessary. If a report
concerns a possible violation by a current leader, they should be excluded
from the response process.

## Reconsideration

Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request reconsideration
of the resolution decision. To make such a request, contact the [ARKA Advisory
Group] with your request and motivation and they will review the case.
