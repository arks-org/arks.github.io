ARK Alliance: Global community for open, decentralized ARK identifiers
supporting research and scholarship. {{ site.num_arks }} ARKs created by {{ site.num_ark_orgs
}}+ orgs.

<!--more-->

Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) serve as *persistent identifiers*, or stable,
trusted references for information objects. Among other things, they aim to be
web addresses (URLs) that don’t return 404 Page Not Found errors. The ARK
Alliance is an open global community supporting the ARK infrastructure on
behalf of research and scholarship.

End users, especially researchers, rely on ARKs for long term access to the
global scientific and cultural record. Since 2001 some {{ site.num_arks }} ARKs
have been created by over [{{ site.num_ark_orgs }} organizations] — libraries,
data centers, archives, museums, publishers, government agencies, and vendors.

ARKs are open, mainstream, non-paywalled, decentralized persistent identifiers
that you can start creating in under 48 hours. They identify anything digital,
physical, or abstract.

ARKs are similar to DOIs, URNs, and Handles. All of them

-   were introduced over {{ site.ark_age }} ago,
-   exist in large numbers ({{ site.num_arks }} ARKs, {{ site.num_dois }} DOIs,
    etc.),
-   start with a string to identify the name assigning authority,
-   require the active updating of URL redirects, and
-   support research and scholarship, appearing in the Data Citation Index,
    Wikipedia, ORCiD.org profiles, etc.

In contrast, ARKs are cheaper, more flexible, and less centralized, letting you

-   create unlimited identifiers without paying for the right to do so,
-   add any kind of metadata, including no metadata,
-   append extensions and query strings during resolution,
-   link directly to an article, image, or spreadsheet that is immediately
    usable by people and software without making them first stop at a landing
    page, and
-   make millions of ARKs resolvable by managing just one ARK, via a mechanism
    called [suffix passthrough].
