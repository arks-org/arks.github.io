This article introduces an ARK training workshop covering ARK persistent
identifiers, their uses, minting, resolution, and more. Taught by John Kunze
and Donny Winston.

The ARK tutorial described below was first offered in 2023 along with
conferences such as Code4lib, IIIF, and JCDL. We hope to offer it at other
conferences and to make a video recording available.

## Course description

Title: *Getting started with ARK persistent identifiers*

In this 3-hour workshop we will introduce you to ARKs (Archival Resource
Keys), which can serve as persistent identifiers, or stable, trusted
references for information objects (eg, web addresses that don’t return 404
Page Not Found errors). For more than two decades, 8.2 billion ARKs have been
created by over {{ site.num_ark_orgs }} organizations — libraries, data centers, archives,
museums, publishers, government agencies, and vendors. We will cover:

-   Why ARKs – non-paywalled, decentralized, flexible
-   Use cases – Smithsonian, French National Library, Internet Archive
-   Metadata for early and ongoing object development
-   How to get started – one form to fill out
-   Minting and assigning ARK identifiers
-   Resolvers, resolution, redirection
-   Object types – digital, physical, conceptual
-   Persistence considerations
-   Available tools

## Instructors

John Kunze is a pioneer in the theory and practice of digital libraries. With
a background in computer science and mathematics, he wrote BSD Unix tools that
come pre-installed with Mac and Linux systems. He created the ARK identifier
scheme (arks.org), the N2T.net scheme-agnostic resolver, and contributed
heavily to the first standards for URLs (RFC1736, RFC1625, RFC2056), library
search and retrieval (Z39.50), archival transfer (BagIt – RFC8493), web
archiving (WARC), and metadata (RFC2413, RFC2731, ANSI/NISO Z39.85).

Donny Winston has a bachelor's degree from the University of California at
Berkeley, and master's and Ph.D. degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, all in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. His doctoral
area of specialization was nanofabrication, with both experimental and
computational work. Donny has worked in a research capacity at IBM Research in
Yorktown Heights, NY; at the National Institute for Standards and Technology
(NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD; at Carl Zeiss R&D in Peabody, MA; at
Hewlett-Packard Labs in Palo Alto, CA; and at Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, CA. He is the owner and principal of Polyneme
LLC; a cofounder of the FAIR Points event series; and host of the
Machine-Centric Science podcast.
