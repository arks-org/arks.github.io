    John Jung is a Senior Programmer/Analyst in the Digital Library Development
    Center at the University of Chicago. He provides infrastructure for digital
    library collections and builds web interfaces to help people search and
    browse cultural heritage materials in useful and satisfying ways. He has a
    lot of experience dealing with datasets and all of their idiosyncrasies, and
    he helps people set up workflows to extract data from legacy systems, and to
    query, transform and load it into new systems from relational to graph
    databases. John has a Master of Design Methods degree from the Illinois

    John Kunze is a pioneer in the theory and practice of digital libraries.
    With a background in computer science and mathematics, he wrote BSD Unix
    software tools that come pre-installed with Mac and Linux systems. He
    created the ARK identifier scheme, the N2T.net scheme-agnostic resolver,
    and contributed heavily to the first standards for URLs (RFC1736, RFC1625,
    RFC2056), for library search and retrieval (Z39.50), for archival transfer
    (BagIt - RFC8493), for web archiving (WARC), and for metadata (RFC2413,
    RFC2731, ANSI/NISO Z39.85). Follow-on work in metadata includes creation
    of the Dublin Kernel and yamz.net.
